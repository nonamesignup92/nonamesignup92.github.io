I want to make as less change to the environment as I can so that life can sustain on earth. In this regard, I want to change atleast one simple thing in my lifestyle every month. This month, my toothbrush had reached end of it's life and I found a bamboo biodegradable toothbrush. The bristles are not biodegradable. But something is better than nothing.
